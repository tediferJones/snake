# snake

Remember playing snake on an old nokia phone?  It's just like that but now you can play with your friends

### How it works
- Powered by Bun, allowing us to serve the web page and run websockets on the same server
- Players can create private games by creating a gameCode
    - If no gameCode is provided the user will be placed into the general lobby
- To win the game you must either have the longest snake, or all remaining players must occupy every available position on the board
- Easily rematch with the same lobby once the game has finished
